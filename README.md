**Intro**
  
Around the US allows users to comfortably view, like, and add images, as well as change profile information, on any device they like, from desktop and laptop computers, down to tablets and mobile devices.

**Technologies Used**
* Media queries to fit all screen sizes
* HTML Forms to allow for changing profile information or adding new images
* Form validation to ensure all information added is applicable
* Grid layout in order to adapt layout and to allow the number of images to scale properly
* OOP to organize the script logic

**TODO** 

* Using the spacing values from the brief, determine if any of them can be represented by a simple calc(Xvw - Ypx) to allow meeting the design requirements for some of them without using media queries. Not because it should be done, but because I want to know. Main example that interested me was the copywrite text in the footer. 
* Save changes made by user for use between sessions.
