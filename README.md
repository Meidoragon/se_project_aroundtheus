**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**TODO** *currently it's more of a prediction of what's to come,but if it never comes to be then it's a proper TODO.*

* Using the spacing values from the brief, determine if any of them can be represented by a simple calc(Xvw - Ypx) to allow meeting the design requirements for some of them without using media queries. Not because it should be done, but because I want to know. Main example that interested me was the copywrite text in the footer. 
* Pull the initialCards const out of index.js and have it be its own file that gets imported. Probably set it up as JSON or something. Would need to include some variety of sorting so that the elements get created in the correct order. But this would allow it to scale for more cards in the gallery.
* Save changes made by user for use between sessions.
