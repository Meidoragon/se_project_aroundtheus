**Technologies Used**
* Media queries to fit all screen sizes
* HTML Forms to allow for changing profile information or adding new images
* Form validation to ensure all information added is applicable
* Grid layout in order to adapt layout and to allow the number of images to scale properly
* OOP to organize the script logic
* Webpack
* API Calls to store and retrieve information saved between sessions

**TODO** 

* Using the spacing values from the brief, determine if any of them can be represented by a simple calc(Xvw - Ypx) to allow meeting the design requirements for some of them without using media queries.
* Expand the HTTP error handler to have different behavior depending on the received status code.
